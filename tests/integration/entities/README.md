# Integration Tests - Entity-Based Structure

This directory contains integration tests organized by entity types rather than by component types. This structure better reflects the game's architecture where core functionality revolves around different entity interactions.

## Directory Structure

### `/roid/`

Tests related to asteroid (roid) entities and their interactions:

- **roidSplitting.test.ts** - Tests asteroid splitting mechanics when destroyed
- **laserCollisionManager.test.ts** - Tests laser collision detection with asteroids

### `/local-player/`

Tests for the local player entity and its interactions:

- **localPlayerRoidCollisions.test.ts** - Tests local player collision with asteroids
- **ship.test.ts** - Tests basic ship functionality and movement

### `/remote-player/`

Tests for remote player entities and multiplayer interactions:

- **laserPlayerCollisions.test.ts** - Tests laser damage between players

### `/bot-player/`

Tests for bot player entities and their behavior:

- **botAsteroidCollisions.test.ts** - Tests bot collision with asteroids and damage handling
- **healthRegeneration.test.ts** - Tests health regeneration mechanics for all player types

### `/input/`

Tests for input handling systems:

- **keybindings.test.ts** - Tests keyboard input handling
- **mouse.test.ts** - Tests mouse input handling

## Benefits of Entity-Based Organization

1. **Clearer Test Organization**: Tests are grouped by what they're testing rather than how they're implemented
2. **Better Test Discovery**: Easy to find tests related to specific game entities
3. **Reflects Game Architecture**: Matches the actual game structure where entities are the primary concern
4. **Easier Maintenance**: When working on a specific entity, all related tests are in one place

## Running Tests

To run all entity integration tests:

```bash
npm test tests/integration/entities/
```

To run tests for a specific entity:

```bash
npm test tests/integration/entities/roid/
npm test tests/integration/entities/local-player/
npm test tests/integration/entities/remote-player/
npm test tests/integration/entities/bot-player/
npm test tests/integration/entities/input/
```
