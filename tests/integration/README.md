## Test Categories

### Browser Tests (`/browser/`)
- **End-to-end tests**: Full game functionality tests that run in a real browser
- **Visual regression tests**: Tests that capture screenshots and verify UI behavior
- **User interaction tests**: Tests that simulate real user interactions

### Server Tests (`/server/`)
- **WebSocket communication tests**: Tests server-client message handling
- **Game engine tests**: Tests server-side game logic and state management
- **Server API tests**: Tests server endpoints and responses

### Entity Tests (`/entities/`)
- **Entity-based tests**: Tests organized by game entities (roids, players, bots, input)
- **Mock-based integration tests**: Tests that use mocks for external dependencies
- **Cross-entity interaction tests**: Tests how different entities interact with each other

## Architecture

The tests are organized using a modular utility-based architecture:

- **`BrowserManager`**: Handles browser setup, teardown, and page management
- **`ScreenshotManager`**: Manages screenshot cleanup, naming, and storage
- **`GameInteractions`**: Encapsulates common game interactions and assertions
- **`HealthChecker`**: Verifies server health before running tests
- **`TestConfig`**: Centralizes test configuration and constants

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher
2. **Game Server**: Must be running on port 3001
3. **Playwright browsers**: Required for browser tests (`chromium` and `chromium-headless-shell`). Cursor Cloud VMs install both during `bash scripts/cloud-agent-install.sh` on boot.

## Setup

1. Install Playwright browsers (local dev; skipped on cloud after `cloud-agent-install.sh`):
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   npx playwright install chromium-headless-shell
   ```

2. Ensure the game server is running:
   ```bash
   # In the main project directory
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:integration:browser    # Browser-based tests
npm run test:integration:server     # Server-side tests  
npm run test:integration:entities   # Entity-based tests

# Run specific test files
npm run test:integration -- browser/sanity.test.ts
npm run test:integration -- server/server-parity.test.ts
npm run test:integration -- entities/roid/roidSplitting.test.ts

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## What the Tests Do

### `Game loads and can fire lasers`
1. Opens a headless Chromium browser
2. Navigates to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Waits for the start screen to load
4. Clicks the play button
5. Waits for the game area to appear
6. Fires 5 times by pressing spacebar
7. Takes a timestamped screenshot
8. Verifies the game is in a playable state

### `Game shows asteroids and bots`
1. Starts the game
2. Takes a timestamped screenshot of the game state
3. Checks for debug info that should show asteroids
4. Verifies the asteroid count is not 0
5. Provides diagnostic information about page content

## Screenshot Management

- **Auto-clear**: Screenshots are automatically cleared before each test run
- **Timestamped**: Each screenshot includes a timestamp for easy identification
- **Organized**: Screenshots are saved in `tests/integration/browser/screenshots/`
- **Naming**: Format: `{test-name}-{timestamp}.png`

## Utility Classes

### BrowserManager
- Manages browser lifecycle (launch, cleanup)
- Handles page creation and cleanup
- Configures browser options and viewport

### ScreenshotManager
- Clears screenshots directory before tests
- Generates timestamped filenames
- Manages screenshot file paths

### GameInteractions
- Encapsulates common game interactions
- Provides helper methods for game state verification
- Handles debug information checking

### TestConfig
- Centralizes test configuration constants
- Defines timeouts, URLs, and selectors
- Makes tests easily configurable

## Output

- **Success**: Creates timestamped screenshots in the screenshots directory
- **Console**: Detailed logging of each step
- **Test Results**: Vitest test runner output

## Integration with Vitest

These tests integrate seamlessly with your existing Vitest setup:
- Use the same test runner and configuration
- Can be run alongside unit tests
- Support for test parallelization and timeouts
- Built-in assertions and mocking

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused**: Make sure the game server is running on port 3001
- **Element not found**: Check that the game UI elements have the expected IDs
- **Browser not found**: Run `npx playwright install chromium` and `npx playwright install chromium-headless-shell`
- **Test timeouts**: Increase timeout values if the game loads slowly
- **Screenshot issues**: Check that the screenshots directory is writable

## Customization

You can easily extend these tests by:
- Adding new utility classes for specific functionality
- Creating new game interaction methods
- Adding more test scenarios
- Customizing browser configurations
- Testing different browsers (Firefox, WebKit)

## Adding New Tests

To add a new test:

1. Create a new test file or add to `sanity.test.ts`
2. Use the existing utility classes for common operations
3. Follow the established patterns for setup/teardown
4. Use `TestConfig` constants for configuration
