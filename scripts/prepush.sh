#
# Invoked by .git-hooks/pre-push (core.hooksPath=.git-hooks, wired by `npm run
# prepare`). The quality gate runs locally on push to main, then a production
# deploy goes to Vercel via the pinned CLI. We deploy from the hook because the
# Vercel↔GitHub git integration is disconnected — the push is now the deploy
# trigger, so a failed deploy fails the push (tight feedback, nothing half-shipped).
#
# Only acts on a non-deleting push to main/master; feature-branch pushes stay
# fast. Escape hatch: FLEET_SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push (audited).

# forward, missing remote sha), so it can only skip too little, never too much.
